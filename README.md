### ***Motivation***

I chose this project because remote work has personally transformed the way I balance my professional and personal life. The flexibility it offers has allowed me to be more present with my family while maintaining productivity at work. Experiencing these benefits firsthand sparked my curiosity about how this shift might also be influencing the nation's economic growth. If remote work can reduce commute times, increase efficiency, and expand opportunities, I want to understand how those individual gains might translate into a broader economic impact.

### ***Questions***

1. How has the adoption of remote communication technology evolved the U.S. economy since 2020?
2. What relationship exists between the rise in remote work and labor productivity trends?
3. How has the GDP and output by industry been affected due to the uproar in remote work?

### ***Normalizing the Data***

For this research, I relied on data from several federal sources, including: 
* the BEA for GDP reporting in the United States
* the U.S. Census Bureau for population counts
* the Bureau of Labor Statistics for breaking down output and labor for each sector
* the Center for Disease Control for the timeline on Covid-19 events

### ***Problems and Challenges***

This project was challenging due to my lack of knowledge on the subject; I learned a lot along the way. Problems with finding and analyzing the data was navigating through the various sites to find usable data that supported my topic. Among that, it was also difficult to locate specific data about remote workers that was not in survey results. Additionally, certain data was extremely limited (mostly in 2020) when the pandemic originally started. 

### ***Technologies Used***

I chose to use Python and Excel for cleaning, analyzing, merging the data, and to create the visualizations. All findings were compiled and organized in Google Slides for a clean presentation.

### ***Sources***

* The U.S. Census Bureau
* The Center for Disease Control (CDC)
* The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
* The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
